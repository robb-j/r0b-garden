I had a hack around with my GPS recorder app, I’ve been using it a lot in the background but haven’t had any time to making it into an actually usable app.

It now keeps rolling stats on your recording to display in the app and in the new live activities! It also has a rudimentary implementation of a Kalman filter to ease the messy GPS data.

Adding a live activity was somewhat easy, it’s cool that it’s all swift and can reuse the View from the main app.

The iOS Measurement API is pretty cool too, once you get your head around it. You can throw values at it and it does a good job of formatting the correct decimal places and abbreviating units to fit. And that’s automatically localised!
