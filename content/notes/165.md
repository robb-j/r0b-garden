I needed a little tool to convert a CD audio book into something an iPod would understand ... so now I've made a PWA to do it with a WASM-based ffmpeg encoder!

it's only just working but I've used it to take a set of .m4a files in the browser, concatenate & converted them together into a single AAC stream, then use the individual file metadata to set up the chapters and set the title/album/artwork on the final output file.

I'm quite impressed with myself, I could have just used the ffmpeg CLI but that would have been no fun. I've not tested it but it should all run offline too .. in theory. You can do so much with web apps these days.
