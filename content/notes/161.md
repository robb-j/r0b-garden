I made a little thing today! I wanted something that would slurp up some structured data for a wizard-of-oz prototype a colleague was deploying.

This is Sator! You run it with a JSON Schema and it’ll store JSON/HTML form responses for you if they pass the schema and auth check.

Only two dependencies too, Gruber (my server lib) and Postgres. You can even run it with the local filesystem, if you don’t need to reach for a full database.
