I’ve done the routine “automate even more things” now I have a new laptop. I can now install all my CLIs, brew apps and App Store apps along with configuring Finder how I like it and @panic’s Nova too! It’s all a big bash script but I’m pretty happy with it.

Next I want to configure the apps in my Dock and menu bar apps too. It’s been a lot of faffing with plist files, would not reccomend.
