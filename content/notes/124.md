Audio Units are pretty interesting, a standard for software instruments, audio processors/effects, midi processors and more! There is a general standard (VST) and also an Apple-only one (AU) of course ðŸ˜’

For creating an Apple one,

Then the same one can be used across different Audio Workstations (DAWs)like Ableton Live or Logic Pro

I wonder if there is an intersection with web standards like the processor being written in #JavaScript and the UI popup being #HTML AND #CSS based.

The processor could be modular JavaScript that takes whatever input and performs logic. The UI could be a web app to configure the software instrument or effect.

This seems along the right lines, I will have to investigate.

This too, but they want you to join their discord a bit too much.
