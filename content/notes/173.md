I finally got around to cutting a big release for my #JavaScript standards-based server library, it now has a fancy #Eleventy website that automatically pulls #TypeScript documentation. The library itself has been improved loads too.

The repo is currently on GitHub,

There's now only 1 dependancy, and that is polyfill for URLPattern
