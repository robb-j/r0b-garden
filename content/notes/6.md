Added a JS Module loader to #ProgrammableThings so you can load other modules on your SD card and played around with the c++ -- JS API to set specific segments from JS #Notes

So on the SD card is a main.js which then does a "import './letters.js' and that script looks like below. The C++ is injecting the "Thing" object and the methods on that are C functions that talk to the GPIO!
