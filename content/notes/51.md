I've started getting tags working with my #DigitalGarden, pulling from the hashtags I've tooted with. Dusting off my #11ty pagination knowledge in the process.

The tags become a handy sidebar to navigate by and are individual markdown pages in the repo too, so I can tweak and merge them together if needed e.g. https://github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/blob/main/content/labels/digitalgarden.md?plain=1
