I was thinking about server app configuration today for #Gruber. I came up with a pretty clean API to load in variables from either configuration/environment variables/command line arguments or fallbacks. I updated my documentation-driven readme exploring it too.

Then I realised that same configuration can be used to document and provide usage examples which is kinda neat.
