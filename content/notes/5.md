<p>I've been tinkering with  an  extension for Nova using the PlatformIO CLI. It's sort of getting there, it installs the CLI and generates the right metadata for Panic's C++ extension to start linting. </p>

<p>Ideally there could be background task that generates the C/C++ metadata for the Icarus extension then some nice tasks to build and flash code onto an Arduino. </p><p>At the moment I'm not sure if PlatformIO/Arduino support the xCode based toolchains that ship with Panic's Icarus extension</p>

<p>I got the "sync" bit working so whenever you edit a C/C++/H or your platform.ini the extension sees that and generates a big "compiled_commands.json" which contains the information to pass to the Icarus extension and I can see that it is seeing it!</p><p>Though it seems the format of my generated file or the arguments within aren't completely compatible with the one Icarus is expecting. More research into this is needed.</p>
