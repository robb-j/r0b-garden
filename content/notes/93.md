Coming back to my old #ProgrammableThings project, it's now called #ScriptableThings!

{% media 369, 500 %}

I've got the sign working again and embedded an "editor" (read as: monospace textarea) so you can directly edit the script on the device through the captive portal!

{% media 370 %}

You join the sign's WiFi and get a popup browser to control the LEDs. Now you can go into advanced mode and edit the animation JavaScript. That script is loaded onto the ESP and runs straight away.

{% media 371 %}
