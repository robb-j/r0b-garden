The web share target should totally be standardised / implemented. Then a PWA could be a target that other apps can share into, like add as a todo or pre-compose a message. #Notes #Web #PWA

WebKit  appears to be “neutral” to the API, citing needing stronger wording while praising use of exiting http standards for the share itself.

Some concerns about fracturing “web” and “web apps” by only allowing APIs in certain contexts but that that is also required when security comes into it.

Sounds like chrome has already implemented and deployed the feature without waiting for others (shock). Firefox has a “positive” position on the API as of November 2024! So that is hopeful
