Now there are some nice menus too! Had a bit of fun using the CSS variables for each workspace to pull the theme/contrasting colour through to the menu itself.

I wonder how nested menus might work using CSS anchor positioning ðŸ¤”

I landed on a semi-nice syntax in the HTML to auto-style button/hr elements inside of the menu.

```html
<menu-layout>
  <button>First</button>
  <button>Second</button>
  <hr>
  <button>Third</button>
</menu-layout>
```

sort of inspired by the future of having a `<hr>` in a `<select>` element.

This project is just for me, but I wonder if it should be a `<ul>` inside that `<menu-layout>` to get the correct aria-labelling
