<p>New test program today:</p><p>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 100_000; i++) {<br>  console.log(i);<br>}</p><p>I want to add an interrupt to stop user-submitted code taking over the device. So if too many statements happen in JavaScript land, I can cancel the program and save the poor ESP tiny CPU and also keep the other systems on the controller working.</p>

<p>I got it to stop if execution is taking too long!</p>
