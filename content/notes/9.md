Added a captive portal to my #ProgrammableThings project today, the ESP broadcasts a WiFi network that when you join, brings up this web page. On the page you can pick segments of the sign and what colour you want them to be and it live updates them. It uses an `<input type=“colour”>` which I’ve never had the chance to use before! #Notes
