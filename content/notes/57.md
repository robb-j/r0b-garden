Turning the §/± into a dedicated terminal button is my favourite change to my computer in a while.

For my Keychron I've remapped it to cmd+alt+shift+T which triggers a Shortcut that opens Terminal.app

In Nova and VSCode the § key (+the shortcut above) is set up to open the integrated terminal. Which takes preference over the Shortcut!

The only downside is the Terminal.app Shortcut doesn't work with the integrated keyboard.
