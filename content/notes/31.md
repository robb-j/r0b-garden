<p>Added a table of “coffee captains” to Year in Rebrew. Basically Strava KOMs for coffee drank during the work day. I’m pretty pleased with how it turned out. It shows the person with the highest average for 30 minute slots of the day. </p><p>I wanted to not have a single leaderboard and try and spread it out so more people could win a slot. </p><p><a href="https://2023-rebrew.openlab.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">2023-rebrew.openlab.dev/</span><span class="invisible"></span></a></p><p>  </p>
