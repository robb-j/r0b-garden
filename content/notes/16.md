<p>Explored SVG visualisation today, i was surprised how much you can do with svg from the DOM. this is pulling live data from our building’s sensors and trying to visualise onto a floor plan I’ve drawn.<br></p>

<p>My friend made a tool for generating an interpolated background from some point data and values, it’s pretty cool!</p>
