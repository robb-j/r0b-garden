Doing some C++ at work and wow itâ€™s hard to go back to from JavaScript ðŸ˜‚ making me manage my own memory and actually plan my data structuresðŸ˜…

Although Iâ€™m working on an interesting library to add a basic JavaScript runtime to ESP microcontrollers to make their software malleable. So overall less C++ needed, which is pretty cool!

Yesterday I got it to run a â€œconsole.log(â€˜hello worldâ€™) and today Iâ€™ve been getting some timers involved. The current target script is:

console.log('starting at ' + Date.now())

setTimeout(
  () => console.log('done at ' + Date.now()), 
  1000
)

Iâ€™ve had to make my own internal timers and track the active ones to keep the program alive until theyâ€™re all complete. And it needs to call the right js function  at the right time too!

The microcontroller doesnâ€™t know about time, so Iâ€™ve added dodgy hack to override Date.now() in JavaScript to return the milliseconds since boot
