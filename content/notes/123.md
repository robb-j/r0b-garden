Made a quick-and-dirty Nunjucks editor to test templates in the browser!  #Notes

Literally just a HTML file, no frameworks here!

Ok now its a PWA too, so you can install it as an app and it looks a bit more nunjucks-y

Ok its got a service-worker too so its offline capable. I'll stop now honest

The offline version seems to be working consistently now, first I forgot to implement the ‚Äúfetch‚Äù processes that actually uses the cache. Second I didn‚Äôt cache the html page itself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It‚Äôs quite nice to have a minimal PWA as an exemplar to quickly reference how it all works
