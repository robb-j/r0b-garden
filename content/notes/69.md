I've been playing around with a little #JavaScript validation tool for a very specific use-case. I'm starting to feel proud of the result and syntax and especially that there is no #TypeScript! So it is pure JS but it can still generates types for the structure-validated values, purely through JSDoc!

Also! you can get it to generate a JSON-schema from your structures. Not sure what to do with that but it seems pretty cool / powerful
