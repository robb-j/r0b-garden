<p>Worked out a nice format for my (#)Review hashtags to go into so I can pull them nicely into the site!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/blob/main/content/films/1.md?plain=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/b</span><span class="invisible">lob/main/content/films/1.md?plain=1</span></a></p><p>The  API is pretty cool and gives you the metadata of your URLs so I don't have to scrape that separately which is helpful.</p><p>I'm thinking of using the "refs" frontmatter to ensure I don't fetch toots twice.</p><p> </p>

<p>I'm also planning to keep all images and media out of the garden repo and whack them into an S3 bucket where I can curate my own content in there too (ie drone footage)</p><p>Those can be "media" entities like below. You also get a "blurhash" which could be fun to play with, I need to learn more about it.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/blob/main/content/media/5931a7b4843c1f4c.md?plain=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/b</span><span class="invisible">lob/main/content/media/5931a7b4843c1f4c.md?plain=1</span></a></p>
