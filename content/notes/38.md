Worked out a nice format for my (#)Review hashtags to go into so I can pull them nicely into the site!

The #Mastodon API is pretty cool and gives you the metadata of your URLs so I don't have to scrape that separately which is helpful.

I'm thinking of using the "refs" frontmatter to ensure I don't fetch toots twice.

I'm also planning to keep all images and media out of the garden repo and whack them into an S3 bucket where I can curate my own content in there too (ie drone footage)

Those can be "media" entities like below. You also get a "blurhash" which could be fun to play with, I need to learn more about it.
