Found something that might make a cool #JavaScript custom element ~

```html
<time-ago
  date="2024-03-18T15:27:30.653Z"
>
  at 18/03/2024, 15:27
</time-ago>
```

You provide an initial value to display (if no JavaScript) then if enabled, it can update the text contents with a friendly relative value and also set the "title" to see the exact date on hover.

Maybe you could set the title yourself so it works without JavaScript?
