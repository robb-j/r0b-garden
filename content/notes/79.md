Going to try and run my garden scrape script every day via GitHub actions. hopefully I'll still have a repo tomorrow ðŸ¤ž

Of course the first one failed https://github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/actions/runs/8791582122/job/24126121697





It seems to be running ok but itâ€™s about a minute each run so Iâ€™ll probably run out of free tier usage soon. Time to optimise
