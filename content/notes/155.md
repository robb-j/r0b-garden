in lieu of a full blog post, here are my notes on notebooks from a while ago. This has been sat in my drafts long enough!

Moleskine — this was my original favourite. Simple, minimal, nice enough paper. There is a bit of bleed through but not too much. It's a non-standard size but its basically A5. The last one I had was this teal, or "Reef Blue".

I'm a soft-cover guy and will not be taking questions.

Leuchtturm — I found this one in a beautiful green colour, this is 100% my colour, aka Rob Green.

The paper seems similar to moleskin. Somewhat minimal, not very. The wording is in german/english/french which takes up too much space. "datum/date" on each page is unnecessary and not a feature I use so in my opionion is bloat.

Page numbers are nice and useful for the contents page, not sure if it fits with my note-taking style either though. Cover feels nicer than moleskin. Nice stickers for archival purposes. Double bookmarks is very useful. I have a two-pointer notetaking/todo style and this works perfectly.

Just look at that beautiful green

Rhodia — now this has lovely lovely paper, 90gsm I believe. There's a nice embossed logo on the front cover and no wasted pages at the front or back. Minimal.

I would have liked an author / title page for lost & found reasons, but this is solvable.

The ribbon feels a bit naff compared to moleskine and Leuchtturm. There is a plasticy feeling cover but there are nice orange card inserts. I would have also preferred a taller first line for page titles.

Uber minimal, all about the writting and lovely paper. I got this in yellow, but they call it orange.

Field Notes — I wasn’t expecting to actually use these but they are quite cute. I think I need a mini pen then I can carry one around with me properly. The quality is really nice and the aesthetic is very pleasing and front/back page details are pleasant and useful. I do like a dot grid, I should commit to a larger-form notebook in dot grid sometime.

I got the pitch-black dot-grid ones.

The field notes has made me really want to get a @studioneat Mark Two, but I have resisted so far...
