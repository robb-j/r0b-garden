#JavaScript shouldn't let you destructure like this ðŸ˜¬

It groups the array by the "username" key on each record then gets the result for the current member using a dynamic accessor and maps it to the name "memberRecords" then sets the rest of the keys to perMember.

A bit gross, will refactor out tomorrow
