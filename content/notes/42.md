title: Digital Garden CLI
---

Added a little CLI to the #DigitalGarden so I can manually add films via their TMDB URL. It seems easier than trying to integrate with Letterboxd.

I'm hoping the more I play about with this and refactor a nice library might emerge, but I'm keeping my use-case as myself for now.
