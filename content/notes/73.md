I got a version of the 'time-ago' component working. It's part of a larger experiment share locations for a pub crawl that I've been playing around with.

The idea is a unique link for the crawl then a few people can use the web app to share their location and the others can stream the live locations to know where to go.

We have this yearly thing where we go around a loop on the Metro and visit pubs along the way. Technically overkill, but fun to play with!
