<p>I've almost got my Mastodon scraper working for Untitled  project! It was getting pretty sketchy so started adding add some unit tests for the more complicated bits </p>

<p>It's quite a mix of tech in there now. It pulls data down using `fetch`, de-duplicates and threads statuses together, then it processes Mastodon's HTML with Cheerio to strip un-useful stuff and now it's reformatting that as YAML front matter and soon creating files in the repo</p>
