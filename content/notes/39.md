<p>I've almost got my Mastodon scraper working for Untitled  project! It was getting pretty sketchy so started adding add some unit tests for the more complicated bits </p>

<p>It's quite a mix of tech in there now. It pulls data down using `fetch`, de-duplicates and threads statuses together, then it processes Mastodon's HTML with Cheerio to strip un-useful stuff and now it's reformatting that as YAML front matter and soon creating files in the repo</p>

<p>It was a pretty big first commit!</p><p> <a href="https://github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/commit/143966798b6ef21538526919820b71ee2063e314" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" translate="no"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/robb-j/r0b-garden/c</span><span class="invisible">ommit/143966798b6ef21538526919820b71ee2063e314</span></a></p>
