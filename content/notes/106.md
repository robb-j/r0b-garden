I want a motivation to work on random things so I’m going to try #AdventOfStuff24. The goal is to do a random thing from my todo list that I’ve probably been putting off.

To keep it simple, I’ll post them to my #Notes section of my digital garden via Mastodon, so they should appear at ~ https://garden.r0b.io/notes/tag/advent-of-stuff-24/

This post will create the tag and feed when the job runs tomorrow morning!


Ok I jumped the gun a little and created the garden label in advance, so that it will properly be generated on the 1st of December. And also updated my cron job so it runs at the end of the day to capture things correctly too.
