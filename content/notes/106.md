I want a motivation to work on random things so I’m going to try #AdventOfStuff24. The goal is to do a random thing from my todo list that I’ve probably been putting off.

To keep it simple, I’ll post them to my #Notes section of my digital garden via Mastodon, so they should appear at ~ https://garden.r0b.io/notes/tag/advent-of-stuff-24/

This post will create the tag and feed when the job runs tomorrow morning!
