I’ve been trying to work out what my digital garden thing is. It’s not POSSE (Publish on Own Site Syndicate Everywhere). It is kind of the opposite, posting on lots of services then pulling it together and re-owning it on my own website.

Maybe PEPE, Post Everywhere Pull Everything?  I still end up owning the content, at least the content I’m interested in, but it is first hosted by the services I post it to before the garden pulls it in.
