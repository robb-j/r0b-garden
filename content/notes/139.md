I added experimental ts-go --lsp support to my even more experimental nova-typescript extension just to see what would happen ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it seems to show hovers and do basic linting.

If you want to try it you need to clone the repo, build with nova, activate the extension then toggle the ts-go setting.
