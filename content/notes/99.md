Finally got around to fiddling with my #DigitalGarden again. I've been sending things to it for the past year using hashtags: #Notes, Review, Photos & TIL

This time I went through all the content it had generated and put some things in place to help curate the content, like to customise how it shows images or references external links.

From this I curated my PC build post quite nicely:

which came from a thread on my old server https://hyem.tech/@rob/112110448144635546

I also found a bug in my fetch/merge tool that forgot to link up images when merging posts together. As its a nice file-based structure I went through and fixed all the links.

The dinosaur footprints I saw on Skye are up there now!
