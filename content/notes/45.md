That documentation-driven-design I mentioned the other day, I wrote it up a bit more and made the repo public if you’re interested! Codename: Gruber, because I’ve been watching too much Die Hard recently.

Generally the idea is to think about #JavaScript web-standards on the server side with the idea that you could have an evergreen base for projects. My bet is being based on web standards, the underlying primitive are solid and won’t go away.
