I got undo and redo working with my map shading tool! also it simplifies the paths so it isn’t storing thousands of points and it’s loads faster.

I wish there was a browser API for undo-redo, that would be super helpful. The best hack I’ve seen is to have a big hidden `<textarea>` to simulate it. It’s a bit gross.
