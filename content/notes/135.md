Got a very basic GPX exporter working to start to visualise the gps data. Had to write it on my iPad 😅

It turns out a 15 mile hike generated a 6.2 MB CSV file, it seems I’m getting several GPS samples per-second from iOS.

It seems a bit messy, so the next exporter will need to clean it up a bit, and reduce the number of samples too. There are “accuracy” values for each metric so that’ll be fun to explore.
