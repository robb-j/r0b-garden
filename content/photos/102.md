New #introduction I guess. Hey I’m Rob a big software nerd that likes making and using websites and apps. By day I’m a Software Engineer for a HCI research group in Newcastle (UK) and I freelance a bit too, if you’ve used the MozFest schedule I made that! I also quite like #photography and #hiking and enjoy playing the #piano to relax plus #films, #lego and #videogames.
