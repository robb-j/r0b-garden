Should have been the “Threequalizer”. Lots of fun here, it could have done with another “cars rolling out” scene, maybe 2. It brilliantly sets up a Rube Goldberg machine for Denzel to trigger, and ooh it does. A few fumbles along the way, perhaps to divert expectations and not quite as much of a payoff as I was hoping. Though there is this banging soundscape poking through the scenes which is a nice cherry on top of the slick action sequences. #Review
