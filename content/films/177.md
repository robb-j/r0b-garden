title: "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"
blurb: As armies mass for a final battle that will decide the fate of the
  world--and powerful, ancient forces of Light and Dark compete to determine the
  outcome--one member of the Fellowship of the Ring is revealed as the noble
  heir to the throne of the Kings of Men. Yet, the sole hope for triumph over
  evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo, who, accompanied by his loyal friend Sam
  and the hideous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of
  Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power.​
