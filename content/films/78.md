Excellent and chilling, definitely worth the IMAX treatment. A few bits of Tommy Shelby did seem to leak through but it held me for the entire duration, and didn’t seem to drag, even with that runtime. I really liked the “avengers assemble” type bit but with real scientists and am glad for some new people to slip into Nolan’s roster.
