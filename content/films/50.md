The world building and cinematography are off the charts. You get thrown into the world with a compelling story all the meanwhile learning the intricacies of it and exploring this tech-filled future. I think the false narrative the trailers threw really put me off, the story it really tells is so much better. The final act felt pretty rushed to set up all the pieces, it could have been fun to play with that heist-vibe more. Great performances, well worth a watch. #Review
