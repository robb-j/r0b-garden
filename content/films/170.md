title: Rush Hour
blurb: When Hong Kong Inspector Lee is summoned to Los Angeles to investigate a
  kidnapping, the FBI doesn't want any outside help and assigns cocky LAPD
  Detective James Carter to distract Lee from the case. Not content to watch the
  action from the sidelines, Lee and Carter form an unlikely partnership and
  investigate the case themselves.
