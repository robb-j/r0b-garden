title: "DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story"
blurb: "When megalomaniacal White Goodman, the owner of a trendy, high-end
  fitness center, makes a move to take over the struggling local gym run by
  happy-go-lucky Pete La Fleur, there's only one way for La Fleur to fight back:
  dodgeball. Aided by a dodgeball guru and Goodman's attorney, La Fleur and his
  rag-tag team of underdogs launch a knock-down, drag-out battle in which the
  winner takes all."
