title: Aftersun
blurb: Sophie reflects on the shared joy and private melancholy of a holiday she
  took with her father twenty years earlier. Memories real and imagined fill the
  gaps between miniDV footage as she tries to reconcile the father she knew with
  the man she didn't.

Somber, calm and eerie all in one, balancing that nostalgia of holidays gone by while reflecting through adult eyes and beautifully told.
