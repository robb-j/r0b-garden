Nice to know where my fear of snakes and sharks came from, although the snakes are a lot faker seeing them again. Some classic bond bits here like the crocodile bridge and bayou boat escape. Plus a bit more henchmen development. This one was a bit more twists and turns for the sake of it and the villain isnâ€™t particularly well motivated
