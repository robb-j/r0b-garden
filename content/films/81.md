This was a bit of a strange one. It’s beautifully shot and started off well but sort of goes of weirdly in places or fumbles around specific scenes. Some of the dialog is just generally ropey and abstract from how people actually talk. It didn’t really seem to flow very well either, scenes happened next to each other but it was jarring to go between them in the way it did.
