Really not as bad as I remember, I’m quite enjoying the slow building Spectre narrative. Yeah it has problems but there is some great character work from Judy Dench and Jeffrey Wright & Craig himself exploring angry, vengeful espionage.

Also shout out to early 2000s’ ideas of multi-touch tables and data visualisation, why aren’t we on that timeline?
