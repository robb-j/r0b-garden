  London and fight to receive the first, new banking license to be issued in
  over 100 years.

A solid 3 star film. Don’t expect too much, it’s a fun watch and not too serious. Some flagrant abuse of what a “northern” accent is, some good Lancaster accents in there but a few too many Yorkshire. Once you’re past that it does what is says on the tin with some nice hearty moments.
