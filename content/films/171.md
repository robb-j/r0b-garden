title: "Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery"
blurb: When young priest Jud Duplenticy is sent to assist charismatic firebrand
  Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, it’s clear that all is not well in the pews. After
  a sudden and seemingly impossible murder rocks the town, the lack of an
  obvious suspect prompts local police chief Geraldine Scott to join forces with
  renowned detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery that defies all logic.
