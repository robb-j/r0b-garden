Great to rewatch after Andor, it fit with the show a lot more than I was expecting but there were bits that didnâ€™t quite work. Like seeing andor unsure about sniping Gailen after things like the events on Gorman. Such a fast pace compared to the show too, if the show took this on it could easily be a whole season! #Films
