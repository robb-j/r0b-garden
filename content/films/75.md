What a film, did not disappoint. It even had a couple of curve balls I wasnâ€™t expecting. I especially loved the new high up top-down camera and transitions between during the museum-y shootout, very hotline Miami, and phwaor that final uphill battle! Also props for playing Genesis by Justice too. Minus half a point for the silly bulletproof suits throughout.
