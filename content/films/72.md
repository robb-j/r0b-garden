Fwah this is a banger of a classic Bond film with loads of memorable bits. That Lotus Esprit Bond car and when it turns into a submarine for starters. It has the introduction of Jaws, a henchman that even survived the film. Some great reds vs blues large scale fighting INSIDE a ship and a fun misdirection at the start as to whole the real henchman actually is. Ooh and a submarine escape scene!

Bond straight up murders the villain in a somewhat unrewarding pay off and there is some cringy “man does it better stuff” that looses it a few points. Bond should have got his ass kicked by Agent Triple X.
