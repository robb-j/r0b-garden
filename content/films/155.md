title: The Running Man
blurb: Desperate to save his sick daughter, working-class Ben Richards is
  convinced by The Running Man's charming but ruthless producer to enter the
  deadly competition game as a last resort. But Ben's defiance, instincts, and
  grit turn him into an unexpected fan favorite - and a threat to the entire
  system. As ratings skyrocket, so does the danger, and Ben must outwit not just
  the Hunters, but a nation addicted to watching him fall.

I thought this was a whole load of fun. I went in pretty blind, just wanting to watch something from Edgar Wright and tbh I recommend it, all the reveals were a lot of fun while not knowing the full cast. I think I’d need to rewatch to look for more classic Edgar tricks. Well worth a watch. #Films
