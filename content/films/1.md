<p>The premise powered me through this film and it delivers with some delightfully violent fight scenes. Though it feels like it took long to get there with a bit of a pants build up. The supporting cast are pretty miss to be honest and just seem to pull you out of the film and you’re just wanting to get back to Harbour’s scenes. <a href="https://hyem.tech/tags/Review" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Review</span></a></p>

<p>I loved all the Die Hard and Home Alone references and it adds nice twists to them too. It feels like it could have licensed some better Christmas music if it’s going to use it over the action. I’m totally there for that Santa origin story and would happily have a few more flashbacks.</p>
