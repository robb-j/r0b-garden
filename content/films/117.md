title: "Top Gear: The Burma Special"
blurb: In this special Clarkson, Hammond and May don’t just buy three knackered
  old lorries and drive miles through the beautiful landscapes of Burma. Oh dear
  no. They actually have to use their lorries to do something useful.  They have
  to build a real, use able bridge over the River Kwai. On their way to the
  river they almost bring down Burma’s power supply, encounter the world’s least
  relaxing truck stop, race around the streets of a deserted capital, saddle up
  a trio of unhelpful horses and attend a completely deranged party.

This feels like a proper classic special, good fun and not too offensive #Films
