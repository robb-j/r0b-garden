title: "Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"
blurb: Ethan Hunt and his team are racing against time to track down a dangerous
  terrorist named Hendricks, who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch
  codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt to stop him
  ends in an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF to
  be implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to disavow them. No longer
  being aided by the government, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks around the
  globe, although they might still be too late to stop a disaster.

<p>Benji is my favourite addition to the series so far, maybe it’s British thing but he really adds to it. Feels like the film is really getting into its “silly over the top” vibe here or perhaps that is just from looking back at the film with new eyes. It’s also works on the heist-esk mission fun. </p>
