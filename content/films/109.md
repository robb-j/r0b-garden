title: "Top Gear: South America Special"
blurb: Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May are dropped deep in the
  Bolivian rainforest armed only with three 4x4s which they bought from the
  local small ads for a maximum of Â£3,500 each. They attempt to drive from the
  heart of Bolivia to the coast of Chile, encountering drug lords and the
  debilitating effects of high altitude. Without a doubt one of the toughest
  challenges the `Top Gear' team has ever faced.
