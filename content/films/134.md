I think this might be the best film of the lot. Not necessarily the best “Star Wars Film” if you know what I mean, it holds up the mirror and examines the Star Wars world. While it doesn’t conform to the usual Star Wars tropes that makes it more interesting. Also everyone was just a dick to Rose, that was awful.

In a post-Andor world I’m all for this type of exploration and examination of the world rather than just retelling the same old stories from a galaxy far far away.

I’m still yearning for more about the rise of the First Order. #Films
