  powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

I enjoyed this a lot, especially the bit where the people in the plane just start shooting at people on the ground for no real reason but it was kinda funny for their character. Definitely a bit CG heavy, if it’s got me wondering if something is CG or not it’s taken me out of the movie and that’s not ok. I quite enjoyed PWB’s role in this and she added something that LaBeouf did not last time.
