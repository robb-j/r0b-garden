It was so good to see this again in the cinema. I always find a new little thing that I haven’t seen before, or have since forgotten.

I had a newfound appreciation for Dr Mann this time, he’s obviously very annoying and a very obvious metaphor for huMANN nature. But watching Damon play that explicitly knowing what he was doing and reacting to things the way you would was good cinema.

I really noticed how good of a Dad McConaughey is to Murph, it really sells that Dad-hate and eventual release. It’s a really nice level of comedy throughout, humorous to break the tension but not distracting from the narrative.

Always shout out to this soundtrack, it is my absolute favourite pulling in those beautiful space organs. #Films

I also really really liked how Damon’s little monologue got completely cut off by his incompetence in opening the airlock. A perfect resolution to a villainous monologue
