title: The Holdovers
blurb: A curmudgeonly instructor at a New England prep school is forced to
  remain on campus during Christmas break to babysit the handful of students
  with nowhere to go. Eventually, he forms an unlikely bond with one of them — a
  damaged, brainy troublemaker — and with the school’s head cook, who has just
  lost a son in Vietnam.

What a lovely film, it hit me in the feels quite a few times! Would watch again. #Review
