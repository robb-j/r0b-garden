This was absolutely fantastic! It’s as if Fincher got to do a Hitman movie and it’s hard not to draw parallels to that series. Some beautiful aesthetics in the shots and cinematography. That fight scene in the house is immense and finds this raw power of the baddie, I’ve not seen a realistic style with such an unnatural feeling at the same time. #Review
