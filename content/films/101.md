title: Shaun of the Dead
blurb: Shaun lives a supremely uneventful life, which revolves around his
  girlfriend, his mother, and, above all, his local pub. This gentle routine is
  threatened when the dead return to life and make strenuous attempts to snack
  on ordinary Londoners.

I’ve so much love for this film, such great performances, vibe & action. Excellent to see it in cinema for the 20th anniversary. I’d forgotten how much Serafinowicz is in this and he does so well. #Review
