title: "The Grand Tour: One For The Road"
blurb: The trio ignore Mr Wilman’s instructions and head to Zimbabwe in three
  cars they’ve always wanted to own, a Lancia Montecarlo, a Ford Capri 3-litre,
  and a Triumph Stag. They embark on a stunning road trip through Zimbabwe’s
  beautiful and sometimes challenging landscapes leading to an emotional
  farewell to their lives together.
