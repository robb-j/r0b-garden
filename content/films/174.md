title: 28 Years Later
blurb: Twenty-eight years since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons
  laboratory, now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found
  ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group lives on a small island
  connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one
  member departs on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers
  secrets, wonders, and horrors that have mutated not only the infected but
  other survivors as well.
