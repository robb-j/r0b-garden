title: "Top Gear: Middle East Special"
blurb: The film predates the Syrian Civil War and involves a 1,200-mile (1,900
  km) road-trip from Erbil International Airport in Iraqi Kurdistan to
  Bethlehem, nominally recreating the journey of the Three Wise Men. Their
  journey takes them across the Middle East via southern Turkey, the cities of
  Aleppo, Palmyra and Damascus in Syria, then Jerash in Jordan and finally the
  Mount of Olives. The journey includes visiting an abandoned theme park, and a
  stop at Ein Gev on the Sea of Galilee.

This one might be the peak silly period of Top Gear, pretty questionable setting too. Fun silly goofs though. #Films
