title: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
blurb: Finding himself in a new era, and approaching retirement, Indy wrestles
  with fitting into a world that seems to have outgrown him. But as the
  tentacles of an all-too-familiar evil return in the form of an old rival, Indy
  must don his hat and pick up his whip once more to make sure an ancient and
  powerful artifact doesn't fall into the wrong hands.
