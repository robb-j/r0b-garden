I can’t decide if this was great or terrible. It also feels like they couldn’t decide what genre this movie is meant to be, hard hitting, a comedy, or thrilling action. It’s as if the director kept changing minds throughout the edit. It does all nicely tie up in the end and Matt Smith is incredible. So worth a watch and please discuss with me. #Films
