title: Sound of Metal
blurb: Metal drummer Ruben begins to lose his hearing. When a doctor tells him
  his condition will worsen, he thinks his career and life is over. His
  girlfriend Lou checks the former addict into a rehab for the deaf hoping it
  will prevent a relapse and help him adapt to his new life. After being
  welcomed and accepted just as he is, Ruben must choose between his new normal
  and the life he once knew.
