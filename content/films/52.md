title: Argylle
blurb: When the plots of reclusive author Elly Conway's fictional espionage
  novels begin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization,
  quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past. Accompanied by her cat
  Alfie and Aiden, a cat-allergic spy, Elly races across the world to stay one
  step ahead of the killers as the line between Conway's fictional world and her
  real one begins to blur.

This was … eclectic. Quite a bit going on and pleasantly entertaining and unpredictable. I live for short Rob Delaney cameos where he dies straight away and I wish I could have the “Samuel Jackson downloading a file” energy in my life. Bonus points too for the musical number and use of frosted tips. Definitely too long but each component felt well paced.
