<p>Well this was delightful to watch, even more so with a full cinema chucking along. I wasn’t sure about Charalama going into this but he did really well and found the character. Such an extended British cast, I started to wonder if the entire cast of Ghosts was in there and I also loved Phil Wang’s little part. All the musical bits were great if a little over-tuned and Grants role was much appreciated. Oh and the Chief’s expanding waist was nicely humorous.  </p>
