title: "Top Gear: The Great African Adventure"
blurb: Another expedition for Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.
  This time around, our intrepid explorers take on the task of finding the
  source of the Nile in three barely roadworthy estate cars. After surmounting
  the worst that the local hotels and traffic jams can throw at them, the
  dynamic trio set off into the heat of the African sun, taking dense forests,
  the ferocious wildlife, and wheel-sucking mud in their stride - well, almost.
