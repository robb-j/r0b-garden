Wow I was blown away by how much this movie went THERE. Fabulous performances from Penn and DiCaprio playing their respective raging nazi and bumbling dad characters. The jaunty physical comedy undertones play weird tricks against wacky characters and simulated military precision. It took a moment to find its feet and set up the characters but that created a chaotic energy that powered through the rest of the runtime. #Films
