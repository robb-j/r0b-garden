I do like this one. It feels “by the books” Star Wars, like there was a checklist of all the things to include. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s very enjoyable and adds new fun new things into the mix.

I would have loved to see the full JJ trilogy play out. I also really want more context of what happened after Return of the Jedi to get to here, Lucas really went the other way with exposition in this trilogy. At least we didn’t have to sit through trade negotiations though! #Films
