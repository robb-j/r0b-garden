title: In Bruges

  mission. While they are there they have time to think and discuss their
  previous assignment. When the mission is revealed to Ken, it is not what he
  expected.

In Bruges … I really can’t tell if this is a film of its time, or it is criticising the films of its time. Either way its language leaves a sour taste. Everything else is excellent. I really love the small scale of it all, a few blokes plodding around a small town, trying to talk about their emotions. I really noticed the progressive soundtrack, building from a meek solo piano at the start to full electric guitars during the shootout. #Films
