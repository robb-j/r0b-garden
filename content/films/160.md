title: Deck the Halls
blurb: Determined to unseat Steve Finch's reign as the town's holiday season
  king, Buddy Hall plasters his house with so many decorative lights that it'll
  be visible from space! When their wives bond, and their kids follow suit, the
  two men only escalate their rivalry - and their decorating.
