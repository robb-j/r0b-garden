title: The Man with the Golden Gun
blurb: Cool government operative James Bond searches for a stolen invention that
  can turn the sun's heat into a destructive weapon. He soon crosses paths with
  the menacing Francisco Scaramanga, a hitman so skilled he has a seven-figure
  working fee. Bond then joins forces with the swimsuit-clad Mary Goodnight, and
  together they track Scaramanga to a Thai tropical isle hideout where the
  killer-for-hire lures the slick spy into a deadly maze for a final duel.

Extra points for Christopher Lee out of the gate, definitely one of my childhood favourites. I quite enjoyed the secret MI6 headquarters that’s on a 45 degree slant. Loved Scaramanga’s car-come-airplane too, just a big fan of Lee’s performance really.
