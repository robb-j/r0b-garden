title: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull
blurb: Set during the Cold War, the Soviets—led by sword-wielding Irina
  Spalko—are in search of a crystal skull which has supernatural powers related
  to a mystical Lost City of Gold. Indy is coerced to head to Peru at the behest
  of a young man whose friend—and Indy's colleague—Professor Oxley has been
  captured for his knowledge of the skull's whereabouts.
