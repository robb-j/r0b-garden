blurb: "Off-duty cop John McClane is gripped with a feeling of déjà vu when, on
  a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation’s capital, terrorists seize a major

  Renegade military commandos led by a murderous rogue officer plot to rescue a
  drug lord from justice and are prepared for every contingency except one:
  McClane’s smart-mouthed heroics."
