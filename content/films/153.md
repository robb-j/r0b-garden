title: "Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl"
blurb: Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions
  proves justified, when Wallace invents a “smart” gnome that seems to develop a
  mind of its own. When it emerges that a vengeful figure from the past might be
  masterminding things, it falls to Gromit to battle sinister forces and save
  his master… or Wallace may never be able to invent again!
