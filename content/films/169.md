title: "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"
blurb: Frodo Baggins and the other members of the Fellowship continue on their
  sacred quest to destroy the One Ring--but on separate paths. Their destinies
  lie at two towers--Orthanc Tower in Isengard, where the corrupt wizard Saruman
  awaits, and Sauron's fortress at Barad-dur, deep within the dark lands of
  Mordor. Frodo and Sam are trekking to Mordor to destroy the One Ring of Power
  while Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn search for the orc-captured Merry and Pippin.
  All along, nefarious wizard Saruman awaits the Fellowship members at the
  Orthanc Tower in Isengard.
