Feels like someone watched Ocean’s 11 absolutely steaming and tried to create their own heist movie the next day. An unlikable protagonist in a stereotypical crew with a poor predictable script, 0 character development, a massively over the top soundtrack and an awful grade.

Also Netflix messed up the subtitles so you by default don’t get any of the Spanish dialog until you turn them all on. #Review
