Love the shift to a gritty, grungy detective Batman, bouncing between the suspects as the clues trickle in. All underpinned by that deep booming soundtrack, I do wish I could have heard that in IMAX. I’d leave Serkis, though it’s probably impossible to fill Caine’s shoes. The physicality of the stunts and set pieces add that down to earth quality and paired with the deco art direction make for a great experience.
