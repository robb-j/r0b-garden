title: Dredd
blurb: In the future, America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is
  Ma-Ma, a prostitute-turned-drug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to
  take over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of
  urban police called Judges, who combine the duties of judge, jury and
  executioner to deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the
  top-ranking Judge, Dredd, discovers that taking down Ma-Ma isn’t as easy as it
  seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.

Not as bad as I’d remembered it. Karl isn’t throwing a spear at a Haradrim or calling a super hero a c*nt, but his judge grows on you. It would be interesting to delve more into the judge world, they’re so badass.
