This is absolutely class. After watching the whole series I have so many thoughts about threads the show is pulling at. Love the student documentary vibe. I especially love the werwolves vibes, not swearwolves! It’s notably missing Colin Robinson, but I wonder if he pulls from Stu a bit. Can’t believe it’s the same intro music too.
