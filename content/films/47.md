This was a fair bit of fun. It interestingly felt like two films spiralling and finally colliding in that starfishy conclusion. One the Suicide Squad and the other of Harley Quinn, her style and tone was a fun juxtaposition to the main narrative.

Generally a mix of hit and miss elements and a bit of forced bonding just before the big fight. I don't think Idris Elba can be not-cool in anything. Big fan of Robbieâ€™s Quinn too.
