I’m not sure what to say about this one. It’s wild and I sort of loved it. Way too long and you sort of feel like they forgot about the main storyline for a while but turns out they didn’t. Of course it had to have a “truck teetering on the edge of a cliff” moment too. Arnie and Lee Curtis was a power couple I did not expect. #Review
