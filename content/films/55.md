title: Bullet Train
blurb: Unlucky assassin Ladybug is determined to do his job peacefully after one
  too many gigs gone off the rails. Fate, however, may have other plans, as
  Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal
  adversaries from around the globe—all with connected, yet conflicting,
  objectives—on the world's fastest train.

A solid film, definitely on the long side, though it does build up some fun characters, maybe one or two too many. No samurai sword fights on the roof of the bullet train sadly. Loved all the little cameos dotted around, nicely done.
