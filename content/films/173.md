title: 28 Days Later
blurb: Twenty-eight days after a killer virus was accidentally unleashed from a
  British research facility, a small group of London survivors are caught in a
  desperate struggle to protect themselves from the infected. Carried by animals
  and humans, the virus turns those it infects into homicidal maniacs -- and
  it's absolutely impossible to contain.
