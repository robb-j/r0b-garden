title: Twins
blurb: Julius and Vincent Benedict are the results of an experiment that would
  allow for the perfect child. Julius was planned and grows to athletic
  proportions. Vincent is an accident and is somewhat smaller in stature.
  Vincent is placed in an orphanage while Julius is taken to a south seas island
  and raised by philosophers. Vincent becomes the ultimate low life and is about
  to be killed by loan sharks.
