Loved this film, very glad for a solo cinema trip for it. It all just feels so real and thought out. That bedtime chat was really heartfelt and endearing with a twist of 4th wall. Explores so many more dimensions than “will they won’t they”.  I felt that last long walk to the Uber was a lovely metaphor for going back to those childhood days then plodding back to reality. Beautiful.
