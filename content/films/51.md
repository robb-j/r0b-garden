Starting on beautiful landscapes and cinematography this sequel puts in loads of cool world building and intrigue into the Dune world. Some fabulous shots and a visceral soundtrack (thanks IX) it carefully navigated the source material while holding back on bits and adding in some tweaks too.

Well over the length of a film, a few things could have been cut (sorry Brolin) and I could not take Walken seriously at all. The love story felt a bit forced and the finale rushed. So many brilliant aspects though, well worth a watch.
