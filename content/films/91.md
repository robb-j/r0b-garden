Civil War really thrusts you into a dark America without pointing fingers. It moves at a good pace building and developing that dark world along the way. Really wish those journalists would wear their helmets more and I really liked the protection shown to them by the forces. The finale hits hard with that eerie America-on-America battle while keeping it grounded on the press. #Review
