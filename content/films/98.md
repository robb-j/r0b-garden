title: The Italian Job
blurb: Charlie's got a 'job' to do. Having just left prison he finds one of his
  friends has attempted a high-risk job in Torino, Italy, right under the nose
  of the mafia. Charlie's friend doesn't get very far, so Charlie takes over the
  'job'. Using three Mini Coopers, a couple of Jaguars, and a bus, he hopes to
  bring Torino to a standstill, steal a fortune in gold and escape in the chaos.

Saw the 4k remaster for the 55th anniversary. It was great! I really noticed the lack of soundtrack and how itâ€™s now weird not to have a constant soundtrack. Also props to John Le Mesurier, I forgot he had a little role in this!

Also also, fun to see it in the Classic at Tyneside Cinema with occasional rumblings of the metro going by underneath. #Review
