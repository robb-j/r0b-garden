title: The Raid
blurb: Deep in the heart of Jakarta's slums lies an impenetrable safe house for
  the world's most dangerous killers and gangsters. Until now, the run-down
  apartment block has been considered untouchable to even the bravest of police.
  Cloaked under the cover of pre-dawn darkness and silence, an elite swat team
  is tasked with raiding the safe house in order to take down the notorious drug
  lord that runs it.  But when a chance encounter with a spotter blows their
  cover and news of their assault reaches the drug lord, the building's lights
  are cut and all the exits blocked. Stranded on the sixth floor with no way
  out, the unit must fight their way through the city's worst to survive their
  mission. Starring Indonesian martial arts sensation Iko Uwais.

Action packed and ridiculously gory, maybe my first time rewatching it since 2014 and it holds up. I feel like this was such a game changer to watch back in the day and you can see all those elements hold up.
