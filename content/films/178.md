title: The Da Vinci Code
blurb: A murder in Paris’ Louvre Museum and cryptic clues in some of Leonardo da
  Vinci’s most famous paintings lead to the discovery of a religious mystery.
  For 2,000 years a secret society closely guards information that — should it
  come to light — could rock the very foundations of Christianity.
