title: "Top Gear: Botswana Special"
blurb: Jeremy, James and Richard each buy a used two-wheel drive car for Â£1500
  and drive it for 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) across Botswana from the
  Zimbabwe border across the Makgadikgadi salt plains and through the Okavango
  Delta to the Namibian border. The Stig's African cousin also makes an
  appearance.
