  clues in the old man's notebook, which his father had mailed to him before he
  went missing. Indy arrives in Venice, where he enlists the help of a beautiful
  academic, Dr. Elsa Schneider, along with Marcus Brody and Sallah. Together
  they must stop the Nazis from recovering the power of eternal life and taking
