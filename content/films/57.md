I thoroughly enjoyed the first half, I love a good verticality meets social status metaphor. Couldn’t get past Reece Shearsmith’s teeth for some reason, maybe I missed something? That dystopian decent into chaos was enthralling, but I feel the film was making too many statements and asking too many questions and it left me a bit confused.
