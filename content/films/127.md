title: La La Land
blurb: Mia, an aspiring actress, serves lattes to movie stars in between
  auditions and Sebastian, a jazz musician, scrapes by playing cocktail party
  gigs in dingy bars, but as success mounts they are faced with decisions that
  begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they
  worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.

I didnâ€™t think I could have more of a crush on Emma Stone. What a beautiful, delightful & moving film.

Shout out to my boy Willis for reminding me this exists and is totally worth a rewatch. #Films
