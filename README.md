## notes

**docs**

- [Minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/developers/javascript/API.html)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)

**thoughts**

- Should posts be numerically identified, should it be some sort of hash, what makes sense most for curate-ability?
- Centralise "tool" configuration into `config.json`?
- What happens to markdown code blocks in toots?
- What can I use the blur hash for?

**goals**

- keep large media out of the repo
- pull content from everywhere
- facilitate curation of content by editing, linking and tagging
- static please

**todos**

- maybe try WebC
- get `tools/mastodon.js` to produce content in the desired format
- get `tools/mastodon.js` to upload media to S3 bucket
