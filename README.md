**thoughts**

- What happens to markdown code blocks in toots?
- What can I use the blur hash for?

**goals**

- keep large media out of the repo
- pull content from everywhere
- facilitate curation of content by editing, linking and tagging
- static please

**todos**

- maybe try WebC
- get `tools/mastodon.js` to produce content in the desired format
- notes should show the `card.url`
- rss feeds
- film date changes aren't working
- organise utils into a `lib/` folder of multiple files
- media overwrite?
- generate labels
- what to do with #HashTags (convert to links from HTML or processes in-markdown?)
- need to merge labels into pages in `statusFrontmatter` + `updatePage`
